It also inspired similar revolutions and uprisings across Europe, leading to the establishment of new classes and new forms of struggle.

When the marginal benefit of consuming an additional cookie is equal to the marginal cost, the consumer is maximizing their total satisfaction or utility."}
{"id": 535, "target": "(B) is the correct answer.\n\nExplanation:\n\nI. MR = P = demand on horizontal function for perfect competition. This is correct. In perfect competition, there are many buyers and sellers, and the product is homogeneous. Therefore, the demand curve is perfectly elastic, and the marginal revenue curve is also horizontal and coincides with the demand curve.\n\nII. P > MR as downward sloping functions for imperfect competition. This is correct. In imperfect competition, there are fewer sellers, and the product may not be homogeneous. Therefore, the demand curve is downward sloping, and the marginal revenue curve is below the demand curve.\n\nIII. Demand and Price are represented as a vertical function for imperfect competition, and this is incorrect. In imperfect competition, the demand curve is downward sloping, not vertical. A vertical demand curve would imply that the quantity demanded does not respond to changes in price, which is not the case in imperfect competition."}

Average variable cost (AVC) and average fixed cost (AFC) are calculated by dividing total variable costs and total fixed costs by quantity produced, respectively. When you add AVC and AFC, you get average total cost (ATC), which is equal to TC/Q. Therefore, TC = AVC + AFC * Q.)\n\n(D) MC = TC - TFC.

If the revenue does not cover the TFC, the firm should consider shutting down in the short run. This is because, in the short run, the firm still has some fixed costs that it cannot avoid, such as rent or equipment lease payments. Therefore, it needs to ensure that its revenue is at least covering these costs to stay in operation.\n\nOption (A) is incorrect because AVC (average variable cost) and MR (marginal revenue) are not relevant for deciding whether to shut down in the short run. Option (B) is incorrect because TR (total revenue) and TC (total cost) are not the relevant costs to consider for a shutdown decision in the short run.

This helps them to maintain their market share and earn profits in the long run.\n\n(A) Firms earn long-run economic profits is not always true for monopolistic competition. In the long run, firms may earn normal profits, but not necessarily economic profits. This is because in the long run, new firms can enter the market and increase competition, which can lead to a decrease in prices and profits.\n\n(B) P = MR = MC = ATC is not applicable to monopolistic competition. This equation represents the condition of perfect competition, where firms are price takers and produce at minimum average total cost. In monopolistic competition, firms have some degree of market power and can set their own prices.\n\n(D) In the long run the market is not necessarily allocatively efficient. Allocative efficiency occurs when the price equals the marginal cost, which is not always the case in monopolistic competition. Firms in this market structure have some degree of market power and can charge prices above marginal cost, leading to a deadweight loss."}

{"id": 624, "target": "(C) is the correct answer. An oligopoly industry is characterized by having significant barriers to entry, which makes it difficult for new competitors to enter the market. This leads to a smaller number of firms in the industry that can have some control over the market and pricing. The other options are not typically associated with an oligopoly."}
{"id": 625, "target": "(D) The demand for labor is derived from the demand for the products produced by labor."}
{"id": 626, "target": "(A) is the answer. In the long run, a perfectly competitive firm operates at the minimum of its average cost curve, not necessarily at the minimum of its average variable cost curve. Therefore, in the long run, price is equal to the minimum of the average cost curve, not the minimum of the average variable cost curve."}
{"id": 627, "target": "(B) is the answer. In a perfectly competitive market, the firm is a price taker, so the demand curve for its product is perfectly elastic, meaning that the quantity demanded of the firm's product does not change as the price changes.

{"id": 637, "target": "(A) is the correct answer.

When the MP is above the AP, the AP will rise, and when the MP is below the AP, the AP will fall.

A shift in the demand curve (to the right or left) changes the quantity demanded at each price, while a shift in the supply curve (to the right or left) changes the quantity supplied at each price. When the supply curve shifts to the left, it means that at each price, there is less quantity supplied, leading to a shortage of the good and a movement along the demand curve to a lower equilibrium price.

In monopolistic competition, there are many firms selling differentiated products, and they can earn economic profits in the short run, but there is no inherent barrier to entry or exclusive ownership of a resource, so there is no need for patents or copyrights. In a monopoly, there is only one firm in the market, and it may have a patent or copyright that gives it exclusive control over a product or technology, which is not present in monopolistic competition."}

{"id": 645, "target": "(A) Decreasing marginal utility as consumption rises.\n\nExplanation: The demand curve is based on the law of demand, which states that as price decreases, quantity demanded increases, and vice versa. This relationship can be explained by the concept of marginal utility, which is the additional satisfaction or utility that a consumer gets from consuming one additional unit of a good or service. As a consumer consumes more of a good, the marginal utility of each additional unit tends to decrease, meaning that the consumer is willing to pay less for each additional unit. This relationship between price and quantity demanded is what determines the shape of the demand curve."}

{"id": 670, "target": "(A) would be the correct answer. When the wage rate of labor (P or wage rate of labor) is greater than the marginal revenue product of labor (MRP) of an additional unit of labor, it means that the labor expense of hiring one more unit of labor exceeds the revenue generated by that additional unit of labor. In this case, it would not be profitable for the firm to hire that additional unit of labor. Conversely, if the wage rate is less than the MRP, hiring one more unit of labor would generate more revenue than the labor expense, so the firm would want to hire that additional unit of labor."}
{"id": 671, "target": "(D) The demand curve is of one continuous function. Explanation: The kinked demand curve model assumes that there is a price leader who sets the price, and other competitors follow. Also, it assumes that there are relatively equal shares of the market and that price is greater than marginal costs. However, the kinked demand curve is not a smooth curve but rather a curve with a sharp bend or \"kink\" at the prevailing price, indicating that a change in price by the firm will result in a discontinuous change in quantity demanded.

If the firm sells its products for $3 each, then the value of the 10 units of output produced by the 3rd worker is $30. Since the firm pays $15 for the 3rd worker, the firm's profit for the 3rd worker is $30 - $15 = $15.\n\nSince the MRPL is the additional revenue the firm receives from hiring an additional worker, and in this case, the MRPL is $30 (the value of the 10 units of output produced by the 3rd worker), the firm should continue to hire workers as long as the MRPL is greater than the wage rate.\n\nSo, the correct answer would be (D) The firm should hire less labor so that the MRPL will decrease. would not be the most true.\n\nThe firm should continue to hire workers as long as the MRPL is greater than the wage rate, and since the MRPL is $30 and the wage rate is $15, the firm should hire more workers."}

{"id": 852, "target": "(C) stomata on the bottom surface and relatively few water-conducting (xylem) cells\n\nExplanation: Since Nymphaea odorata is an aquatic plant, its leaves are always in contact with water. Therefore, it would be more advantageous for the plant to have its stomata on the bottom surface of the leaves (submerged underwater) to reduce water loss by preventing direct exposure to air. Also, since the plant is surrounded by water, it would have relatively few water-conducting cells (xylem) as it doesn't require extensive transportation of water from the roots to the leaves."}

{"id": 1015, "target": "(A) is the answer. The House Rules Committee determines both the rules of the House and the conditions for legislative process. This committee plays a significant role in deciding how legislation is considered and voted on in the House of Representatives."}
{"id": 1016, "target": "(A) is the answer. The Supreme Court has the discretion to decide which cases it will hear, and it typically agrees to hear only a small fraction of the cases appealed to it. Therefore, it is common for the Court to refuse to hear an appeal."}
{"id": 1017, "target": "(A) is the answer. The preclearance provision of the Voting Rights Act is not likely to explain low voter turnout for an election. This provision was in place to ensure that states with a history of discrimination did not implement voting changes that would negatively impact minority voters.\n\nThe other options are more likely to contribute to low voter turnout. Low levels of political efficacy among registered voters (B) can lead to a lack of motivation to vote. Regulations that require voters to show identification (C) can create barriers to voting for some people. The frequency with which state and local elections occur (D) can also contribute to low voter turnout, as voters may feel overwhelmed or disengaged with the political process if elections are too frequent."}
{"id": 1018, "target": "(D) The candidate who wins the majority of votes in the House."}
{"id": 1019, "target": "(C) is the answer. In an open primary election, any registered voter may participate, regardless of party affiliation.

{"id": 1047, "target": "(B)\n\nExplanation: The line-item veto allowed the president to veto specific provisions of a bill, which is also known as a partial veto. This was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court in the case of Clinton v. City of New York (1998) because it was found to give the president the power to change the legislation that was passed by Congress, which is a violation of the Presentment Clause of the Constitution. The Presentment Clause requires that after a bill has passed both houses of Congress, it must be presented to the president for his signature or veto. The court found that the line-item veto violated the constitutional separation of powers by giving the president the power to unilaterally change legislation passed by Congress.\n\nSo the answer is (B) allowed Congress to eliminate sections of legislation without a two-thirds majority. Because line-item veto allows president to eliminate sections of legislation without the need of a two-thirds majority to override a presidential veto."}

This was done to insulate the Senate from public opinion by giving the power of election to a body that is not directly elected by the people."}
{"id": 1056, "target": "(D) Congressional power over the bureaucracy is less than that of the president."}
{"id": 1057, "target": "(A) is the answer. The majority of Supreme Court justices are indeed appointed by presidents of the same political party, as the president's party affiliation often plays a significant role in their appointment process. (B) is not necessarily true, as some justices have prior judicial experience while others do not. (C) is not true, as Supreme Court justices serve for life and do not switch party affiliation during their term.

{"id": 1077, "target": "(D) John Locke\n\nExplanation: The principles of freedom and equality in the Declaration of Independence were greatly influenced by the beliefs of the English philosopher John Locke. He argued that individuals have natural rights to life, liberty, and property, and that governments are instituted to protect these rights. If a government fails to do so, people have the right to rebel and form a new government. These ideas are reflected in the Declaration's statement that \"all men are created equal\" and have the right to \"life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\" (Thomas Hobbes and Niccolo Machiavelli had very different political philosophies, and Jonathan Edwards was a religious revivalist, not a political philosopher.)"}
{"id": 1078, "target": "(D) delays in the confirmation of those nominated to be ambassadors would be the answer in this case.

{"id": 1884, "target": "(A) increase imports \n\nHere's a quick explanation if you're interested:\n\nWhen the dollar depreciates, it means that each unit of foreign currency can buy more dollars. As a result, foreign goods and services become cheaper for Americans, which leads to an increase in imports (option A). Additionally, traveling abroad becomes cheaper for Americans, which can also increase (options B). Exports (option C) might see a temporary increase due to the initial depreciation shock, but they will likely decrease in the long run as foreign goods become more expensive for other countries. A trade surplus (option D) occurs when a country exports more than it imports. Since depreciation of the dollar increases imports and may not have an immediate impact on exports, it is more likely to decrease a trade surplus."}

{"id": 1891, "target": "(D) is the answer. The Phillips curve represents the inverse relationship between inflation and unemployment in an economy."}
{"id": 1892, "target": "(A) would be the correct answer. If real GDP per capita is growing at a rate of 10% per year, it would take approximately 70 years for it to increase 10-fold (due to the rule of 70, which states that you can divide the number 70 by the growth rate to estimate the time it takes for the variable to increase 10-fold). Since we want to know how long it takes for the standard of living to double, we need to divide the time it takes for it to increase 10-fold by the number of times it needs to double to increase 10-fold. Since 10 is 2 to the power of 3.3, it would take approximately 3.3 doublings for the standard of living to double. Therefore, it would take approximately 3.3 times 7 years, or about 23 years, for the standard of living to double. However, the closest option given is (A) 10 years, which is not correct."}

{"id": 1899, "target": "(D) $50 in excess reserves. The reserve ratio is the percentage of total deposits that a bank must hold in reserve. In this case, the bank must reserve $50 out of $500 in checking deposits, so the reserve ratio is $50/$500 = 0.1 or 10%. Excess reserves are the amount of money a bank has above and beyond the required reserves, so the bank has $500 - $50 = $450 in total reserves and $450 - $50 = $400 in required reserves, leaving $50 in excess reserves."}
{"id": 1900, "target": "(A) is the answer. The government increasing spending and taxes by the same amount keeps the budget balanced, but the increase in spending (a component of aggregate demand) still has an expenditure multiplier effect on output. The tax multiplier is not relevant in this case because taxes do not change independently of spending. Therefore, the effects are expansionary, not contractionary."}

{"id": 1935, "target": "(A) is the answer. During economic expansions, automatic stabilizers cause government expenditures to increase and taxes to decrease. This is because as the economy grows, some government programs that are tied to economic conditions, like unemployment benefits, will naturally expand and increase government spending.

{"id": 1939, "target": "(C) is the answer. When both expansionary fiscal policy (increasing government spending or decreasing taxes) and expansionary monetary policy (lowering interest rates and increasing money supply) are used at the same time, it leads to an increase in aggregate demand, which in turn increases output and employment in the short run. As a result, unemployment and real GDP will not decrease or increase dramatically, and inflation will not decrease.

Expansionary fiscal policy typically involves increasing government spending or decreasing taxes, which can lead to increased interest rates due to increased demand for loanable funds.\n\n(C) is correct. Expansionary monetary policy involves increasing the money supply, which can lead to decreased interest rates. However, when interest rates decrease, there may be increased demand for borrowing, which can drive up interest rates again. This can \"crowd out\" private investment, as the increased demand for borrowing raises interest rates and makes it more expensive for businesses and individuals to borrow.\n\n(D) is not correct.

{"id": 2023, "target": "(C) Buying Treasury securities from commercial banks.\n\nExpansionary monetary policy is a strategy used by a central bank, such as the Federal Reserve, to increase the money supply within an economy. This is typically done through actions that either increase the amount of money available in the economy or lower interest rates, thereby encouraging borrowing and spending.\n\nIn this case, the correct answer is (C) Buying Treasury securities from commercial banks. When the Federal Reserve purchases Treasury securities from commercial banks, it increases the amount of money in the banking system, which in turn leads to an increase in the money supply. This is because banks now have more money to lend out, which can lead to an expansion of credit and economic activity.\n\nThe other options are incorrect for the following reasons:\n\n(A) Increasing the discount rate: This would actually be a contractionary monetary policy, as it would make it more expensive for banks to borrow money from the Federal Reserve. This would reduce the amount of money available for lending and could lead to a decrease in economic activity.\n\n(B) Increasing the reserve ratio: This would also be a contractionary monetary policy, as it would require banks to hold a larger percentage of their deposits in reserve. This would reduce the amount of money available for lending, which could lead to a decrease in economic activity.\n\n(D) Lowering income taxes: This would be an example of expansionary fiscal policy, not monetary policy. Lowering income taxes can increase disposable income, which can lead to increased consumer spending and economic growth. However, it is not a tool used by the Federal Reserve to implement monetary policy."}

{"id": 2031, "target": "(D) France has the absolute advantage in cheese. \n\nFrance requires fewer labor hours to produce a unit of cheese compared to Belgium, so France has the absolute advantage in cheese. It's not mentioned that France has the absolute advantage in wine, so options (A) and (D) can be eliminated. \n\nTo determine if France has the comparative advantage in cheese, we would need to know the labor hours required to produce a unit of wine in Belgium. Since this information is not provided, we cannot choose option (C). \n\nTherefore, the correct answer is (D)."}
{"id": 2032, "target": "(C) is the correct answer. When nominal GDP is rising, it indicates that the economy is growing, and as a result, the demand for money typically decreases. This is because the purchasing power of the dollar is falling, which reduces the incentive for people to hold money as a financial asset. As the demand for money decreases, the interest rate also tends to decrease.\n\nTherefore, the answer is (C): decrease as the purchasing power of the dollar is falling decreasing the interest rate."}

{"id": 2036, "target": "(A) only. Explanation: When the reserve ratio is increased, banks are required to hold a larger portion of their deposits as reserves, which will increase excess reserve levels. The other options do not necessarily increase excess reserves. For example, when checking deposits increase, banks may choose to hold more reserves, but they are not required to do so. Similarly, when the discount rate or the Fed funds rate is increased, banks may choose to hold more reserves due to the increased cost of borrowing, but they are not required to do so. When the Fed sells Treasury securities to commercial banks, it is reducing the amount of reserves in the banking system, which will not increase excess reserves."}
{"id": 2037, "target": "(B) is the correct answer for the question. Nations cannot consume beyond the production possibility curve through free trade. This curve represents the maximum combination of goods and services that a nation can produce with its given resources and technology. However, free trade allows nations to specialize in the production of goods and services in which they have a comparative advantage, leading to increased efficiency and output. This specialization allows nations to consume a mix of goods and services that is otherwise unattainable through domestic production alone, but it does not enable consumption beyond the production possibility frontier."}

{"id": 2039, "target": "(A) Increases decreases surplus\n is the answer. During a long period of economic expansion, tax revenue collected by the government tends to increase due to higher economic activity and employment, leading to more income being taxed. At the same time, the amount spent on welfare programs may decrease because fewer people are in need of assistance. This combination of increased revenue and decreased spending can lead to a budget surplus."}

This is because some of the additional income may be saved, and part of it may be used to pay taxes or to pay off debt. As a result, consumption increases by less than the full amount of the increase in disposable income, and some of the additional income is saved. This means that options (B), (C), and (D) are not correct, because they all involve saving increasing by less than or equal to the full amount of the increase in disposable income."}
