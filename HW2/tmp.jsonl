{"ID": 1429, "target": "The answer is (A).\n\nThe Law of Diminishing Marginal Returns states that as output increases, the marginal product of labor decreases.

{"ID": 1447, "target": "The answer is (B)\n\nIn perfect competition, the demand curve is a horizontal line, which means that the quantity demanded is constant at any given price. This is because there are many buyers in perfect competition, each of whom is small relative to the total market demand. As a result, the price is equal to the marginal revenue.\n\nIn imperfect competition, the demand curve is downward sloping. This is because there are a few large buyers in imperfect competition, each of whom can influence the price. As a result, the price is greater than the marginal revenue."}

{"ID": 12200, "target": "The answer is $1,000.\n\nThe marginal propensity to consume is the change in aggregate demand resulting from a change in consumer spending. If $100 of new autonomous private investment were added to an economy, the change in aggregate demand would be $100.
