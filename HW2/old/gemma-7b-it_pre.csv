1393,"The answer is (A).

Collusion between large firms in the same industry can lead to higher output levels and higher prices. This is because firms in a collusive agreement can control the quantity of output that is produced, and they can charge a higher price for their product."
1394,"The answer is D.

When rival firms follow a price decrease, the demand curve facing an oligopolist will consist of two discontinuous segments. This is because the demand curve for an oligopolist is derived from the demand curves of the individual firms in the industry. When one firm decreases its price, the other firms will follow suit in order to prevent themselves from losing market share. This results in a demand curve that is made up of two discontinuous segments, one for each firm."

The marginal benefit of eating a cookie is the change in total benefit from eating one more cookie."
1447,"The answer is (B)

In perfect competition, the demand curve is a horizontal line, which means that the quantity demanded is constant at any given price. This is because there are many buyers in perfect competition, each of whom is small relative to the total market demand. As a result, the price is equal to the marginal revenue.

In imperfect competition, the demand curve is downward sloping. This is because there are a few large buyers in imperfect competition, each of whom can influence the price. As a result, the price is greater than the marginal revenue."

1926,"The answer is (D)

Cellular respiration is a process that occurs in cells to convert glucose into energy. The process consists of glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain. In the electron transport chain, electrons are transferred from NADH and FADH2 to oxygen.

In Python 3, the slice operator `[]` is used to extract a subsequence of elements from a sequence. The syntax is:

```python
sequence[start:stop:step]
```

where `start` is the starting index, `stop` is the ending index (exclusive), and `step` is the step value.

If the `start` index is negative, it is interpreted as counting backward from the end of the sequence. So, `abc`[-1] is equivalent to `abc[len(abc) - 1]`, which returns the last character in the string `abc`, which is `a`."

Algorithm I sets the maximum value to -1 before iterating through the list, so it will not work correctly if the maximum value is the first value in the list. Algorithm II sets the maximum value to the first data value, so it will not work correctly if the maximum value is not the first value in the list."
8063,"The answer is (A) 9.

The method max(int[] array) returns the largest integer in the array. The method max(int num1, int num2) returns the larger of the two numbers.

8070,"The answer is (B).

The procedure FindName is designed to find the index of a name in a list of unique names called nameList. If the name is not found, the code should display 0. However, the code is not working correctly because it is not properly updating the foundIndex variable. In the current code, the foundIndex variable is being updated to 0 in the ELSE block, which is incorrect. It should be updated to 0 in the ELSE block only if the name is not found in the list.

Therefore, the procedure call that can be used to demonstrate that the procedure does NOT work as intended is (B)."
8071,"The answer is (B).

The compareTo method returns an integer representing the difference between the strings strA and strB in alphabetical order. If strA is less than strB, the return value is negative. If strA is greater than strB, the return value is positive. If the two strings are equal, the return value is 0.

So, in this case, strB is less than strA and strC is greater than strB. Therefore, the answer is (B)."
8072,"The answer is (B).

The procedure Mystery takes a positive integer number as input and repeatedly subtracts 2 from number until it becomes 0 or less.

The nextIntInRange method returns a random integer in the range low to high, inclusive. To generate a random integer in this range, the method first generates a random decimal number between 0.0 and 1.0 using the Math.random() method. 

Then, the method multiplies the random decimal number by the range high - low and adds low to the result. Finally, the method casts the result to an integer.

This process ensures that the method will return a random integer in the range low to high, inclusive."

GDP measures production, income earned during the production process, and spending by consumers, businesses, and governments."
11891,"The answer is (A).

When aggregate demand declines, GDP falls and the price level also falls. This is because when there is less demand for goods and services, businesses produce less of those goods and services, which in turn leads to a decline in GDP. The price level also falls because there is less demand for goods and services, which leads to a decline in the demand for money, which in turn leads to a decline in the price level."

When the United States places an import quota on imported sugar, consumers will seek substitutes for sugar and products that use sugar."
12010,"The answer is (B)

The crowding-out effect occurs when an increase in government spending reduces private sector borrowing and investment. This is because when the government spends more money, it reduces the amount of money available for private sector borrowing. This can lead to a decrease in private sector investment and economic growth.

If the central bank increases the reserve ratio, it will reduce the amount of money available for private sector borrowing. This will exacerbate the crowding-out effect."
